# Door-Lock-Simulation

#Introduction

The majority of systems are now automated in order to handle new difficulties and
current demands and produce good outcomes. Automated systems are more
flexible, reliable, and accurate since there are fewer manual activities involved. In
order to lower the risk of house invasion, a low-cost electronic home security
system which can be coordinated with other security measures is essential in
current culture. In this modern era, traditional locks are being replaced by
innovative and advanced methods to ensure the safety of our homes, offices, and
personal spaces. A password-based door lock system offers a seamless and secure
solution that allows authorized users to gain access by entering a unique password.
A keypad or touchscreen panel that is connected with an electronic lock mechanism
makes up a password-based door lock system. A predefined password is given to
authorized users, who enter it into the system to unlock the door. The password
can be customized and quickly updated as needed to ensure the highest level of
security and do away with the requirement for actual keys.

#Project Objective:

The major goal of creating this password-based door lock system is to use our
knowledge of microcontrollers and Assembly Language acquired through CSE331
(Microprocessor Interfacing and Embedded System) to give many more
contemporary security features than mechanical locks.

#Goals:

i. To develop a door lock security system through micro controllers.
ii. Simply pressing the pre-determined password on the keypad will unlock
the door.
iii. Boost user flexibility and security levels to prevent unauthorized access.
iv. To provide a door locking-unlocking system that is more efficient and
secure for the user.
